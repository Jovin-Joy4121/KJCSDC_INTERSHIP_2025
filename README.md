Day-3


**Task**
Create a Java application that manages student enrollments in courses using MongoDB. Use
embedded documents for some data and referenced documents for others, to understand their
structural differences. Upload the code to GitHub with the name Day3-Task
** Requirements
MongoDB Collections
students — stores student details
courses — stores course details
enrollments — stores enrollment records
**Document Structure
In enrollments:
One document should embed both
student and course data.
Another should reference them using
ObjectIds.
To do:
1. Insert sample students and courses.
2. Add two types of enrollments (embedded and referenced).
3. Query and print both types with full details.
4. Update a student's name and mention the difference between updating a referenced
document compared to embedded.
5. Create indexes for querying the students
6. Share the screenshot of the result in the readme file.
