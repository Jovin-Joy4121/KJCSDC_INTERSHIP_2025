**📅 Day 3 - MongoDB Integration**

**✅ Task: Student Enrollment System using MongoDB**

Java Application to:

Manage students, courses, and enrollments.
Demonstrate use of embedded vs referenced documents.
📋 Requirements:

**✅ MongoDB Collections:**

students — stores student details
courses — stores course details
enrollments — stores enrollment records


**✅ Document Structure:**

One enrollment embeds student and course details.
Another enrollment references student and course documents via ObjectId.


**🚀 To-Do:**

Insert sample student and course data.
Create enrollments:
One with embedded documents.
One with referenced ObjectIds.
Query and print both types with full details.
Update a student's name:
Observation: Updating embedded vs referenced documents shows how references remain consistent across documents, while embedded data must be updated in every instance.


**Create indexes on the students collection for efficient querying.**

Include screenshots of:
Students collection
Courses collection
Enrollments collection
