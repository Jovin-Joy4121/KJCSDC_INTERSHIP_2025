**ðŸ“… Day 3 - MongoDB Integration**


**âœ… Task: Student Enrollment System using MongoDB**

Java Application to:

Manage students, courses, and enrollments.

Demonstrate use of embedded vs referenced documents.

**ðŸ“‹ Requirements:**

**âœ… MongoDB Collections:**

students â€” stores student details

courses â€” stores course details

enrollments â€” stores enrollment records



**âœ… Document Structure:**

One enrollment embeds student and course details.

Another enrollment references student and course documents via ObjectId.


**ðŸš€ To-Do:**

Insert sample student and course data.

Create enrollments:

One with embedded documents.

One with referenced ObjectIds.

Query and print both types with full details.

Update a student's name:

Observation: Updating embedded vs referenced documents shows how references remain consistent across documents, while embedded data must be updated in every instance.



**Create indexes on the students collection for efficient querying.**

Include screenshots of:

Students collection

Courses collection

Enrollments collection
